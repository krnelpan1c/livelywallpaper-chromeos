## Wallplayper for Chrome OS

Get live and interactive wallpapers for your Chrome OS device. I made this working around the limitations of a managed device from a school or workplace, it does not need the Linux container or even the Play Store to be enabled. This is because managed devices usually restrict the Linux container, and also I don't wan't to publish to the Play Store since that requires a registration fee, approval by Google, and overall is just pretty involved. 

## New Version
This proof of concept is now discontinued, however a new and more functional version is available now featuring user uploadable wallpapers:
